A <b>protocol</b> is a set of rules that controls the communication.
<br><br>
Some of key elements that were used are: <br>
(i) Syntax, <br>
(ii) Semantics <br>
(iii) Timings <br>
<br>
<b>Syntax:</b><br>
It deals with the structure of the data. <br>
The first 8 bits is the sender address, the next 8 bits is the receiver address and the remaining bits are the message. <br>
<br>
<b>Semantics:</b><br>
It deals with each section of the bits. <br>
A particular pattern is analyzed.<br>
Example: IP routing <br>
<br>
<b>Timings:</b><br>
How data can be sent faster? And when data can be sent? This entirely deals with the network performance.
