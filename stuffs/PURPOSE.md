<b>Purpose</b>
***
***
The purpose of this folder is to maintain/share "some" of the traditional resources (which can be found anywhere in internet) that i will be using for my independent research activities in this energetic young age rather than wasting my energy in idleness.
<br>
The modern resources will also be shared. But, it can be found all over the internet. <br>
Just to make sure that i am not sharing anything brilliant. <br>

<b>Different parts</b> will be:- <br>
"How do we relate them and turn them as a possibility?" <br>
"How can we make a better planet?" <br>
"How can we build powerful technologies in real?" <br>
"How can we reach another solar system?" <br>
"How can we date aliens as easier as humans?" LOL
