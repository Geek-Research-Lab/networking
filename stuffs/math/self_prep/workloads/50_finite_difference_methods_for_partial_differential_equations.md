```
Review of 2nd order PDEs : 
Classification, separation of variaqbles and fourier transform techniques.

Automatic mesh generation techniques : 
Structure mesh ( transfinite interpolation), 
unstructured grids ( triangulation for polygonal and non - polygonal domains).

Finite difference Methods : 
Elliptic equations ( SOR and conjugate gradient methods, ADI schemes), 
parabolic equations ( explicit, back - ward Euler and Crank - Nicolson method, LOD), 
hyperbolic equations ( Law - Wendroff scheme, Leapfrod method, CFL conditions), 
Stability, consistency and convergence results.

Lab Component - software packages : 
ODEPACK and MATLAB.
