## Optimization
```
Unconstrained optimization using calculus (Taylor's theorem, 
convex functions, coercive functions).

Unconstrained optimization via iterative methods 
(Newton's method, 
Gradient/ conjugate gradient based methods, 
Quasi- Newton methods).

Constrained optimization 
(Penalty methods, 
Lagrange multipliers, 
Kuhn-Tucker conditions). 

Linear programming 
(Simplex method, 
Dual simplex, 
Duality theory).
