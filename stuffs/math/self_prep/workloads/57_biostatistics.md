Introduction to clinical trials and other types of clinical research,
bias and random error in clinical studies, 
overview of Phase I-IV trials, 
multi-center trials; 
randomized, 
controlled clinical trials; 
concept of blinding/masking in clinical trials. 

Design of Phase 1-3 clinical trials: 
parallel vs. cross-over designs, 
cross-sectional vs. longitudinal designs, 
review of factorial designs, 
objectives and endpoints of clinical trials, 
formulation of appropriate hypotheses (equivalence, non-inferiority, etc.); 
sample size calculation; design for bioequivalence/

bioavailability trials, 
sequential stopping in clinical trials.

Analysis of Phase 1-3 trials: 
Use of generalized linear models; analysis of categorical outcomes, 
Bayesian and non-parametric methods; 
analysis of survival data from clinical trials

Epidemiological studies: 
case-control and cohort designs; 
odds ratio and relative risk;
