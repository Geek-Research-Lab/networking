Paths and homotopy, 
homotopy equivalence, 
contractibility, 
deformation retracts.

Basic constructions: 
cones, 
mapping cones, 
mapping cylinders, 
suspension.

Cell complexes, 
subcomplexes, 
CW pairs. 

Fundamental groups. 
Examples (including the fundamental group of the circle) and applications (including Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem and Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, both in dimension two). 
Van Kampen's Theorem, 
Covering spaces, 
lifting properties, 
deck transformations. 
universal coverings (existence theorem optional). 

Simplicial complexes, 
barycentric subdivision, 
stars and links, 
simplicial approximation. 
Simplicial Homology. 
Singular Homology. 
Mayer-Vietoris Sequences. 
Long exact sequence of pairs and triples. 
Homotopy invariance and excision (without proof).

Degree. Cellular Homology. 

Applications of homology: 
Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem, 
Invariance of dimension,
