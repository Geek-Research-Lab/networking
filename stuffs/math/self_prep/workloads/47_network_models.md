## Network Models
```
Recap of Linear Programming and duality. 
Transportation and Assignment. 

Maximum flow and minimum cut ---
(duality, 
Ford and Fulkerson algorithm, 
polynomial time algorithms). 

Minimum Cost Flows --
(cycle cancelling algorithms, 
successive path algorithms). 

Matching -- 
(bipartite matching, 
weighted bipartite matching, 
cardinality general matching).

Routing algorithms --
(Bellman Ford algorithm in computer networks, 
Dijkstra's algorithm in computer networks), 

Application of network models.
