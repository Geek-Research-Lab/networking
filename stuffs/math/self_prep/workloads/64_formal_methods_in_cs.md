## Formal Methods in CS
```
Propositional Logic and First Order Logic: 
Syntax and semantics. 
Proof systems such as Hilbert, 
Natural Deductions, 
Sequent and Resolution, 
Clasual Form, 
Herbrand Theorem, 
Unification and Resolution Theorem Proving, 

Applications of logic to Program Specification and Verification: 
specification of Abstract Data Types, 
Hoare logic, 
assertions, 
invariants, 
weakest preconditions, 

Formal models of programs: 
Complete partial orders as domains, 
continuous functions, 
domain constructors, 
fix point. 
Denotational semantic of a while-do language.
