closed sets, 
neighbourhoods, 
bases, 
subbases, 
limit points, 
closures, 
interiors, 
continuous functions, 
homeomorphisms. 

Examples of topological spaces: 
subspace topology, 
product topology, 
metric topology, 
order topology. 

Quotient Topology :

Local -compactness. 

Separation Axioms: 
Hausdorff spaces,

Complete Regularity, 
Normality, 
Urysohn Lemma, 
Tychonoff embedding and Urysohn Metrization Theorem, 
Tietze Extension Theorem.
